This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam in Email and SMS messages using a dataset from Kaggle. The model is trained to classify messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on their content.

After preprocessing the text data by cleaning and transforming it into numerical features, various machine learning algorithms are tested to find the most accurate one. The selected model is then fine-tuned for better performance.

The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to easily input messages and get instant predictions on whether they are spam. This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in spam detection and highlights the importance of accessible deployment for real-world applications.
